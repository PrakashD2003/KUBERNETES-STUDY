# Specifies the API version used to create this object
apiVersion: v1

# Declares the type of Kubernetes object — here it's a Pod
kind: Pod

# Metadata provides information about the Pod, such as its name and labels
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod           # Name of the pod
  labels:                   # Labels are key-value pairs used for organizing and selecting resources
    app: nginx              # A more conventional label (useful for service selectors)

# The specification of the Pod — defines how the pod and its containers should behave
spec:
  containers:               # List of containers to run in the pod (a pod can run multiple containers)
  - name: nginx-container   # Name of the container (can be different from the pod name)
    image: nginx            # Docker image to use for the container (will be pulled from Docker Hub by default)
    
    resources:              # Resource requests and limits for the container
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"     # Maximum amount of memory this container can use
        cpu: "500m"         # Maximum CPU this container can use (500 millicores = 0.5 core)
    
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80     # Exposes port 80 on the container (used for HTTP traffic by default in nginx)
